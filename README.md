## Introduction

Welcome to the setup guide for the Ngo-Valsco React JS project! This document will walk you through the steps required to set up and run the project on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js: [Download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- Git: [Download and install Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Clone the Repository

Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Priyankav624/Ngo-Website-Valsco-.git
```

Replace `your-username` and `your-react-project` with your GitHub username and the name of your React project.

## Navigate to the Project Directory

Change into the project directory using the following command:

```bash
cd Ngo-Website-Valsco-/NGO/
```

## Install Dependencies

Install the project dependencies using the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

This will download and install all the required packages listed in the `package.json` file.

## Run the Application

Once the installation is complete, you can start the development server with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command will build the project and open it in your default web browser. The development server will automatically reload the application whenever you make changes to the source code.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `src/`: Contains the source code for the React application.
- `package.json`: Defines the project dependencies and scripts.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

- `npm run dev`: Runs the app in development mode.
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.

## Learn More

To learn more about React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).
